# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
- It is important that credit card companies recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for the items they did not purchase.  
- From the Kaggle Dataset of 2013 European Credit Card Holders experimented on several machine learning models like Knn, Decision Trees to a bit advanced models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
-  Since the percentage of fraudulent transactions in the dataset were very less, i.e. the dataset was imbalanced, implemented techniques like SMOTE and AdaSync.
- Finally calculated the efficacy of the above models by using parameters like ROC-AUC score and Recall score.
